# Orpheus
Database of journals and publishers attributes built in Django. For a brief overview of this project, see [this blog post]( https://unlockingresearch-blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?p=2371).

Installation instructions and the beginnings of what will hopefully grow into a proper user manual (most available sections written for OSC staff; links and some details will not work for other users) can be accessed [here](https://github.com/osc-cam/orpheus/blob/master/docs/manual/manual.pdf).
